# Omphalos

Omphalos is a "Broadcast Graphics Framework and Application"; that description
is taken directly from [NodeCG][1], which is the spiritual successor to this
project. Spiritual in the sense that this is an entirely distinct code base
that is meant to produce a similar application, but with varying features and
in a different way.

The goal of Omphalos is to be your one stop stream control center for streaming
broadcast graphics. While you **CAN** control your stream with it (with an
appropriate extension `bundle`), and although it **CAN** replace a
[StreamDeck][2], the intent is to give you full creative control over the
**CONTENT** that you create.

More information can be found in the [documentation][3], including what it can
do, how it does it and (perhaps most importantly) what the name means.

This is still a work in progress and initially started life as my [Devember][4]
project for [2022][5].
